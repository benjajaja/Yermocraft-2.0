# Type of culling logic to use in the case of a hard-cap cull.
# Options:  
#   RANDOM - will produce random culling with equal weight to every living entity.
#   PRIORITY - will produce priority based culling
#
# On priority based culling, we keep mobs in descending priority order.
#     Priority 1 - Named mob.
#     Priority 2 - High value persistent mobs (horses, villagers).
#     	Golems specifically not added as they can be auto'ed leading to an unfortunate culling scenario.
#     Priority 3 - tame wolves, colored sheep, tame cats.
#     Priority 4 - low value persistent mobs.
#     Non Priority - non persistent mobs.

# For the hard cap culling using priority culling strategy, what is the percent
#   of total mob population that a super-chunk (6 chunks) needs to contain in order to 
#   trigger a penalty purge.  This would require running a purge specifically against this 
#   chunk in order to get the mob-counts in this chunk back to the average mob-per-chunk
#   serverwide.
#
# Setting this value too high (disabling it in essence) will allow players to cause global cullings by 
#   by having high priority mobs (named/leash/horses) in large densities in their own chunks without
#   a problem.  By setting this to a reasonably percent, these player chunks would be first targeted
#   by a culling in order to bring them down to the average mob-per-chunk value.
#
# NOTE:  a value of 100 = 100%, a value of 15 = 15%, etc.
